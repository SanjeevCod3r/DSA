-> The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), also known as the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) or Highest Common Factor (HCF), 
is the largest number that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.

Example:

Find GCD of 48 and 18
Factors of 48:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48

Factors of 18:
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Common Factors:
1, 2, 3, 6

Greatest Common Factor:
6

Thus, GCD(48, 18) = 6 âœ… 


How to Find GCD?
1. Prime Factorization Method
Break numbers into prime factors.
Multiply the common prime factors.

ðŸ”¹ Example: GCD(60, 48)

60 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 5
48 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3

Common factors: 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 = 12
GCD(60, 48) = 12 âœ…

2. Euclidean Algorithm (Efficient Method)
Uses the formula:

GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a mod b)
Keep dividing until the remainder is 0.
