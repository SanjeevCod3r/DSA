Quick Sort:
------------
QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element, 
partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the subarrays.

1. How QuickSort Works:

📍Choose a Pivot (can be the first, last, middle, or a random element).
📍Partition the Array:
    -> Move elements smaller than the pivot to the left.
    -> Move elements larger than the pivot to the right.
📍Recursively Apply QuickSort to left and right subarrays.

3. Time Complexity Analysis:
Best Case -> O(n log n)	-> When the pivot divides the array into two equal halves at each step.
Average Case -> O(n log n) -> Most random distributions result in balanced partitions.
Worst Case -> O(n²) -> Occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (highly unbalanced partitions).

4. Space Complexity:
-> O(log n) for recursion stack in the average case.
-> O(n) in the worst case (if partitioning is highly unbalanced).

5. Stability:
Not stable → Relative order of equal elements may change.
Alternative → Merge Sort is stable.

6. Advantages of QuickSort:
✅ Fast on Average – O(n log n) in most cases.
✅ In-Place Sorting – Uses less memory than Merge Sort.
✅ Efficient for Large Datasets – Used in real-world applications.

7. Disadvantages of QuickSort:
❌ Worst Case is O(n²) – If the pivot is poorly chosen.
❌ Not Stable – May not preserve duplicate order.
❌ Recursion Overhead – Can cause stack overflow for large arrays.
